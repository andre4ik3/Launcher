//! Launcher - Secure Store
//! This module handles storage of secure information for the launcher - primary credentials.
//! Rundown of how it works:
//! 1. Generate an encryption key once on startup.
//! 2. Store it in the system's keychain (e.g. macOS Keychain). Read it from there in the future.
//! 3. Use said key to encrypt and decrypt another config file with all the credentials.
//! 4. If the credential is ever lost for some reason, do everything again.
