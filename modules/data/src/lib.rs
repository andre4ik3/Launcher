//! - [core::assets]
//! - [core::conditional] - Data-driven condition API.
//! - [core::game]
//! - [core::java] - Models for downloading and using Java builds.
//! - [silo] - Models for APIs used during Silo data generation (requires `silo` feature).
//! - [web::microsoft] - Models for interacting with Microsoft's authentication API.
