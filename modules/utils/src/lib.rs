//! Launcher Utilities Module
//! =========================
//!
//! This module is full of random code that doesn't distinctly belong anywhere else or warrant its
//! own separate module, yet is still used in various places throughout the code. It includes:
//!
//! - [directories] - Abstractions for common directories across platforms.
//! - [log] - Functions for setting up logging and panic hooks.
//! - [platforms] - Constants for the current platform.
