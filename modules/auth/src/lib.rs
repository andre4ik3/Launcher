//! Launcher Authentication Module
//! ==============================
//!
//! This module deals with everything to do with online account authentication. Each authentication
//! service is divided into its own module, such as [MicrosoftAuthenticationService] for MSA
//! accounts, or [OfflineAuthenticationService] for offline-mode accounts. All authentication
//! services implement the [AuthenticationService] trait and return [Account]s, ready for use in
//! higher-level code.
