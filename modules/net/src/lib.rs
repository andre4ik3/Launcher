//! Launcher Networking Module
//! ==========================
//!
//! This module contains all network-related functionality. This crate is the only one that depends
//! on the [reqwest] crate, providing safe wrappers around it that add a request queue, retry logic,
//! download resuming, and some generally nice utilities.
