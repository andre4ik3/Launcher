//! Launcher Persistence Module
//! ===========================
//!
//! This module is responsible for persisting data between app restarts. It provides two ways of
//! doing so - the [FileRegistry] and the [DirectoryRegistry].
//!
//! The [FileRegistry] is the easiest to explain, understand, and use. The main thing it does is
//! read and write *something* to/from a file. The *something* can be any type, as long as it
//! implements [Default], [serde::Deserialize], and [serde::Serialize]. The data can also optionally
//! be encrypted - the registry will fully manage the encryption. Other than that, it also manages
//! access to the data, meaning it is safe to access concurrently (there can be any number of
//! readers, but only 1 writer concurrently). This allows it to be used as global state. In the
//! Launcher it is used in 2 places - the app config and the account credentials.
//!
//! The [DirectoryRegistry] is a bit trickier. It is similar to the [FileRegistry], however, instead
//! of holding just one of T, it holds multiple instances (like a [Vec]). Each element is saved to a
//! file, with the file name being tied to the element as its' ID (so now our [Vec] is a
//! [std::collections::HashMap]). The final piece of the puzzle is that each file is stored in its
//! own directory (hence the name), essentially giving each element its' own permanent directory.
//! This is perfect for things like Java installations, downloaded asset catalogs, and instances,
//! as each individual element is indexed.
